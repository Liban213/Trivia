Trivia! 

Implement a trivia game where questions are read from an external file containing 21 Questions and Answers. 
The program should load these questions along with its multiple choice correspodent and present them to the player one by one and record their responses with a lives and score system. 
Players should be rewarded for correct anwsers with points depending on the level of the round, program should also display the  
Importantly, the system should gracefully handle errors, such as invalid input o, providing informative error messages to aid troubleshooting
